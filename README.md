<hr class="solid">

# what's this?
this is my personal NixOS Flake (and hopefully a working home manager) configuration! it's intended for my personal use only, so if you plan to use this you should change some of the user specific settings.

# what's the file structure like?
the structure of this is very simple to understand!

the `common` directory contains some shared .nix files which are used for both my laptop and desktop configuration

the `configurations` directory contains some files which are used for machine specific settings (swap size, etc.)

the `flake.lock` & `flake.nix` files are just your usual flake files.

# okay, how do i install this?
installation guide coming soon!

# thanks for reading!
